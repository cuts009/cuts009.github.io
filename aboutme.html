			<p>Cutter's first experience with college was a community college in his hometown, Amarillo
			College. In college, he was nominated as a tutor for the math department where he developed
			a love for teaching. The next year, Cutter was elected Student Body President, an experience he
			had not expected he would ever have. During his time in this role he made amazing friends
			and learned a lot about himself especially pertaining to leadership and communication.
			Unfortunately, he had a break in my education due to several hurdles that life threw in
			his direction.<br><br>
						
			For the next three years he worked a couple of jobs in food and back-end retail. He enjoyed
			working but his ambitions were beyond where he was going. In the Summer of 2017, Cutter and his
			wife just celebrated our first anniversary, they were contemplating expanding their family, Cutter
			wanted to finish his education, and their current lifestyle would not support these goals. Cutter
			began the process to join the US Air Force and enlisted early in 2018.<br><br>
			
			In the US Air Force, Cutter was trained as a Cyber Surety Technician and has worked in this job ever
			since. As a cyber professional, he has governed hundreds of organizations, trained even more personnel,
			and	managed billions of dollars in equipment. In 2021, Cutter was selected as a US Space Force transfer
			and was one of the first enlisted members to swear into the new military force. He continues to develop
			his cyber security and programming expertise. He is looking forward to continuing a learn wherever he
			finds hiimself.</p>
