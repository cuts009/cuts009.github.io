		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I am Cutter Love, I am a Non-Commissioned Officer in the United States
			Space Force (USSF). My expertise has been cyber security since 2018 and I am
			pursuing educational skills relating to penetration testing. I am projected to 
			graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Programing Technology in December
			2021. I later plan on appling to graduate school to pursue of Masters of Engineering
			in Software Engineering.
			</p>

			<p>I am married and have 1 daughter. My favorite hobbies include hiking,
			snowboarding, and building computers. For my next computer build I plan on my
			first GNU/Linux OS at home. I have dabbled with the OS before, but never for an
			everyday device, I am looking forward to it. I also play a lot of D&D, I enjoy 
			being a DM for but I also enjoy being a player when I have the oportunity.
