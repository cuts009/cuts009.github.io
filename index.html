		Space Force (USSF). My expertise has been cyber security since 2018 and I am
		pursuing educational skills relating to penetration testing. I am projected to

		snowboarding, and building computers. For my next computer build I plan on my
		first GNU/Linux OS at home. I have dabbled with the OS before, but never for an

		being a DM for but I also enjoy being a player when I have the oportunity.
